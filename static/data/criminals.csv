Both had recently left from a bar and had been drinking that night. While asleep in the car, the victim was awoken to a knock on the driver door window. The subject at the window identified himself as a police officer and began questioning the two about a possible DUI. The suspect requested the victim’s license, registration and insurance. The victim was directed out of the vehicle and brought to the rear of her car. The victim was further questioned and ""frisked"" on the inside of her legs and breasts. The suspect told the victim that because the keys were in the ignition, she could face a DUI charge. The victim questioned the suspect as to his name and badge number but was told to stop asking or she would be handcuffed and arrested. The suspect directed the victim to come with him to his patrol vehicle to submit to a portable breath test. The suspect walked the victim to a nearby alley where he pushed her against a telephone pole. The suspect first digitally penetrated the victim and then sexually assaulted (penile) her.

The victim was lost and had stopped on the highway shoulder to update her GPS. The offender approached her driver’s side window and asked if she was okay. He then ordered her out of the vehicle and displayed a handgun, possibly a small compact, black, semi-automatic. The suspect ordered the victim to the backseat of his vehicle, described as a late model Jeep Cherokee, or similar, gray or blue in color with cloth fabric. The victim was sexually assaulted in the backseat of the suspect’s vehicle. After the assault, the victim was ordered out of the car and left at the side of the road. The suspect was last seen making a U-turn and driving back towards Boulder.</p>
<p>The victim did not recall seeing the suspect’s vehicle on the shoulder when she first stopped and did not see the suspect’s vehicle pull up behind her. The description of the suspect is vague, and it is believed he was a white male, approximately 5’11” in height.</p>
<p>After further interviews with the victim, she was able to provide additional details about the offender: a white male with longer; bondish arm hair. He had rough hands similar to a person who works with his hands. She described a tattoo on his upper left arm, possibly green in color, circle shape. She was only able to see the lower portion of the tattoo, due to a short-sleeve shirt covering the rest of the tattoo.</p>",,,https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/unknown-suspect-9,,,"[{'url': 'https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/homicides-and-sexual-assaults/unknown-suspect-9/vicap-boulder-county-co-rev-may-2014.pdf', 'name': 'English'}]",,b0d732c5-1822-4c59-89f2-22d0cec7a3fb,,,,,,https://api.fbi.gov/@wanted-person/b0d732c5-1822-4c59-89f2-22d0cec7a3fb

<p>Muegge was severely burned and found lying face down under a large amount of debris which had fallen from the ceiling. Muegge had stab wounds and blunt force injuries on her head and neck. A knife was found in the living room, where the fire is believed to have been ignited by an accelerant. Muegge’s underwear was down around her knees; yet there were no signs of a sexual assault. In addition, a large sum of money was left in the house, however, the victim’s cell phone and wallet were never located.<p>

<p>Two past incidents of possible interest involving Muegge occurred in the years prior to her murder, which are detailed as follows: On September 3, 2003, Muegge reported a suspicious white male in his 50s named Frank,
whom she had met through a friend. The report indicated she did not feel comfortable with this man on her property, but no further information or reports were ever documented. Separately on February 12, 2006, Muegge
reported that two of her bottle-fed sheep had been shot. It was later determined that the sheep had been shot with a 22 caliber rifle.<p>

The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information necessary to log into online banking accounts. While Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator, others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised web sites.

<p> </p>
<p>On November 23, 1962, Wright and an accomplice, who was arrested, shot and killed the owner of a gas station in Wall, New Jersey, during the commission of a robbery at the business.  On December 13, 1962, Wright was indicted for the murder.  He entered a plea of ""no defense"", and was sentenced to prison for a period of 15 to 30 years.  Then, on August 22, 1970, Wright escaped from the New Jersey State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey.  The State of New Jersey issued an arrest warrant for Wright after he was charged with escape and, on August 26, 1970, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Wright in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, Trenton, New Jersey, after he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid confinement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On July 31, 1972, Wright, and others who were arrested, hijacked a Delta Airlines jet en route from Detroit, Michigan, to Miami, Florida.  The hijackers used handguns and made threats against the passengers on the plane.  At the time, Wright used the name Reverend Larry Burgess, wore the clothing of a cleric, and carried a Bible.  He used a gun concealed in the Bible to confront the aircraft's pilot and crew.  After a ransom was delivered to the hijackers, the passengers were released in Miami.  The hijackers and the plane's crew then flew to Boston, Massachusetts, refueled, picked up an international navigator, and flew to Algiers.  The plane and ransom were then returned to the United States Government, while the hijackers remained free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On September 26, 2011, after more than 40 years as a fugitive, Wright was arrested in Portugal.  He was released from custody in October of 2011, and remains in Portugal, where he continues to live.  Wright is the sole hijacker to remain at large.</p>",Virginia,[],0,"['George E.

They checked into the Amana Holiday Inn (along Interstate 80, just outside of Williamsburg) that evening and were found deceased the following afternoon by the motel maid. The victims had been stabbed to death, possibly with an axe or hatchet that had a 3 ½ inch blade. The male victim had seven stab wounds to his arms, hands, face, head, and neck/throat (including possible defensive wounds to his hands). The female victim had twelve stab wounds to her face, head, and neck/throat. There were no signs of forced entry into the motel room and no obvious signs of sexual assault. The victims were in bed, face-down, partly under the covers. The male victim was wearing only his underwear and the female victim was fully clothed. The victims’ personal belongings were scattered and approximately $200 was taken. Small pieces of a bar of bath soap were on the floor next to the bed. The word ""this"" was printed on the bathroom door, possibly using the bar of soap, and toothpaste was squeezed into the bathtub. Investigators have identified two cases with similarities to the instant case: the homicide of a 25-year-old male in Galesburg, Illinois, on June 24,1980 and the homicide of a 23-year-old male in Meridian, Mississippi on October 26, 1970. Like the instant case, the Galesburg and Meridian victims were away from home and staying in a motel room just off a busy Interstate. Additionally, in all three cases, toothpaste was found in an unusual location at the crime scene, the weapon used is believed to be a machete or sort of axe/hatchet, and money was taken. </p>
<p>If you have information relevant to this investigation, or know of other cases that resemble the details of this homicide (e.g., victim(s) was killed in a motel room near a busy interstate; weapon used was an axe, hatchet, or machete; toothpaste or soap was found in an unusual location at the crime scene; writing or drawings were left at the crime scene), please contact the agency below.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>At approximately 4:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time (CDT), Flight 00901 departed from France Field, Colón, Panama, with a destination of Panama City, Panama. The flight exploded shortly after takeoff, killing all 21 people on board. Authorities are seeking information that may pertain to possible suspect(s) and the crime that occurred aboard this flight. All deceased passengers and crew in the Flight 00901 crash were claimed, except one. A body has possibly been identified as Ali Hawa Jamal. He is suspected of carrying the bomb aboard the aircraft.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to reports, an unidentified Middle Eastern male used the stolen credit card of a US citizen to rent a Mazda 4x4 at a Vantage Rent-a-Car located in Panama City, Panama, on May 27, 1994. The next day the same unidentified individual called the car rental agency and stated he wanted to rent a second car, a Jeep Cherokee 4x4, as his friend was using the initial car that was rented. The individual charged both cars to the stolen credit card. Both cars were later found abandoned near Tocumen Airport in Panama City, Panama.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On  May 28, 1994,  it was further reported that possibly the same Middle Eastern male utilizing the same stolen credit card, purchased a two-line telephone system from a Panamanian business. Ali Hawa Jamal had a Motorola Radio P-500 radio with him during the ill-fated flight of Alas Chiricanas Airlines Flight 00901.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is unknown if the unknown Middle Eastern males were associates of Ali Hawa Jamal. The unknown males are believed to have traveled to Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Lebanon. It is suspected that the Middle Eastern males were in contact with individuals in the region that has been linked to weapons traffickers. The Sidon, Lebanon based terrorist group Ansar Allah expressed support for the bombing through multiple media outlets. It is suspected that the attack was linked  to a terrorist group or groups allied with Ansar Allah's political beliefs.</p>",Black,,https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/ali-hawa-jamal/bombing-of-alas-chircanas-airlines-flight-00901,,,"[{'url': 'https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/ali-hawa-jamal/bombing-of-alas-chircanas-airlines-flight-00901/download.pdf', 'name': 'English'}, {'url': 'https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/ali-hawa-jamal/bombing-of-alas-chircanas-airlines-flight-00901/alas-bombing-poster-spanish-1.pdf/@@download/file/Alas Bombing Poster (Spanish).pdf', 'name': 'EN ESPAOL'}]",,dfc16386d75e44c58239c4e858ac0e16,69,,black,,Light,https://api.fbi.gov/@wanted-person/dfc16386d75e44c58239c4e858ac0e16

<p>Anderson was convicted and sentenced to over 300 years in prison for the 1999 kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Xiana Fairchild in Vallejo, California, and other crimes. He was captured after one of his kidnap victims was able to escape. Anderson was interviewed by FBI agents in November of 2007, and confessed to murdering eight victims in the United States, including Fairchild and 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia of Pinole, California. Anderson also confessed to two murders in Mexico, but did not provide any information on those victims.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the stateside victims’ descriptions given by Anderson in chronological order:</p>
<p>Late 1984: Victim #1 was described as a female ""runaway"" in her late teens/early 20s. Anderson allegedly met and killed her and then disposed of her body near a local swimming hole in Marysville, California. Victim #2 was a young female hitchhiker in her late teens, whom Anderson claimed he picked up on a road near the northeast side of Clearlake a few days after the death of Victim #1.</p>
<p>Early 1985: Victim #3 was a female in her late teens, also residing in the Marysville area, who was possibly a runaway from Oregon.</p>
<p>November 1986: Victim #4 was about 21 years old. She was a light-skinned Black female whom Anderson met in a bar frequented by African-Americans located in the East Bay, off Interstate-80 on San Pablo Avenue. He claimed this occurred about 10 days after he was paroled from San Quentin State Prison. Anderson allegedly killed her and disposed of the body in the Oakland hills.</p>
<p>June 1988: Victim #5 was Amber Swartz-Garcia, who Anderson said was standing on a street in Pinole, California, when he physically forced her into his car. He eventually murdered her in Arizona.</p>
<p>1988/1989: Victim #6 was allegedly a Navajo Indian woman about 23 to 24 years old. Anderson claimed he picked her up coming out of a bar near 5th or 6th Street in Benicia, California. He said he then killed her near Benson, Arizona.</p>
<p>In 1989, Anderson received a ticket while driving a two-door, brown, 1977 Chevy sedan.</p>
<p>February or March 1997: Victim #7 was a Black/Hispanic female in her early 20s with noticeable ""junkie tracks"" on her arms who went by the name “Rosie”. Anderson allegedly met her at “The Bears” bar, which he described as being frequented by Hispanics. This bar was located under Highway 87 in San Jose, California, near a bowling alley. After killing her, he allegedly disposed of her body near the Ben Lomand turnoff near Santa Cruz, California. During this incident, Anderson stated he had been driving a black Toyota truck from his “Parts Company”.</p>

Although no one was wounded, the device could have caused significant injury and casualties if people had been close to the blast.</p>

<p>At around 5:00 a.m., Salinas sent a text message to her boyfriend stating she was going to his residence. Salinas then spoke with the cab driver, confirming that he was en route to pick her up at a convenience store in close proximity to her residence.

The couple never married and in June of 2001 the relationship ended. The two became embroiled in a very lengthy and aggressive custody-visitation dispute in the San Diego Family Court. In early November of 2004, the mother reportedly mentioned to the father that she and the children were planning a 2-week vacation in New Zealand. He told her that the trip would violate the court orders, and Fernandez's attorney was served with a notice of an ex-parte hearing scheduled for November 8, 2004.  At the hearing, a judge ordered that neither parent could take the children out of the jurisdiction of the court and that the children's passports were to be relinquished. The passports were never returned. Also, in November it was reported that Fernandez abruptly left her job and a relative filed a missing person's report for her. Fernandez may have fled with her children to the Philippines.<br /><br />On December 9, 2004, a state warrant was issued in the state of California, San Diego County, charging Francina Dacanay Fernandez with three counts of child abduction. A federal arrest warrant was subsequently issued on February 4, 2005, in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, charging Fernandez with international parental kidnapping.</p>
